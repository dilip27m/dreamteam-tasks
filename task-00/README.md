# Ubuntu Installation

---

## Approach 

I installed Ubuntu as a dual boot alongside Windows by following official documentation and watching a YouTube tutorial for better clarity.
i have installed ubuntu file and rufus.Ubuntu took a lot of time for downloading nearly 3hrs.

## Personal Review 

Installing Ubuntu and setting up dual boot felt like working on a computer like a pro! It was a nice  experience 
Installed Ubuntu sucessfully.
