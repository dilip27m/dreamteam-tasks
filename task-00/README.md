# Ubuntu Installation

---

## Approach 

I installed Ubuntu as a dual boot alongside Windows by following official documentation and watching a YouTube tutorial for better clarity.

### Steps for Dual Booting:

1. **Create Disk Space:**
   - Open Disk Management using the command:
     ```bash
     diskmgmt.msc
     ```
   - Allocate space for Ubuntu. I personally allocated **100 GB**.
   - **Issue faced:** There were two unallocated spaces of **70 GB** and **30 GB**.  
     - To resolve this, I deleted the middle E: drive, which merged the unallocated spaces into one.

2. **Download Required Tools:**
   - **Ubuntu ISO**: [Download Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
   - **Rufus**: [Download Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)

3. **Prepare Bootable USB:**
   - Use Rufus to create a bootable USB drive with the Ubuntu ISO.

4. **Change BIOS Settings:**
   - Disable **Secure Boot** in BIOS.

5. **Install Ubuntu:**
   - Boot from the USB drive and follow the installation steps to set up Ubuntu alongside Windows.
