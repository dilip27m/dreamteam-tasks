# Frontend development using Next.js


### Approach i followed
The approach i followed for this task .I have never a documentation till now in my life i use to watch
videos form youtube and udemy or my friends explain ,for the first time in my life i have read the documentation 
in this dreamteam tasks 

first i started reading the documentation and it was some what was confusing and also the dead was preponed so 
i need to do more work with less concepts.so i taught it would take so much time if i read the entire documentation
so i started watching a 4hrs next.js video in freecodecamp i learnt some basics like routing,index,dynamic pages etc 
but this small concept took 3 hrs for me to understand later i changed i learnt only the topics which i require from google
and documentation and css from udemy angelina and started building the project,i was getting so many errors and i use 
link provided by next.js and use to implemnt in other pages.If i wont understand there i will use google and stack overflow
and most of the errorrs i got the solutions 

### Review of the task
I personally felt this task is very useful which will also be useful for my campus projects and for future projects also
and understood that we need to learn by creating projects,this task was very useful.
