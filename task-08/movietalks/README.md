# Frontend using Next.js

### Approach
I started reading the documentation and i was not understanding that much.so, i decided to see a youtube video of feecodecamp 4hrs video for just seeing 1hr video it consumed my 4hrs 
as was parallely making the project showing in the video.so i decided to stop watching the video as it is talking much time to explain basic concepts .but from the video i learnt about routing ,index,page.js and dynamic files .later i started building the project with this and some documentation knowledge.i was getting to many errors but the link for the error was by next.js itself i use to read it and solve and apply the knowledge for next pages implemntation ,if dont know some function i will google and learn that or stackoverflow most my errors were solved by next.js it self some were done by stack overflow


### Review of the task 
This task was very useful for me i can use this knowledge for my campus and future projects also from this task i learnt we should not learn entire concept and then work on projects instead we need to learn by working on projects .
