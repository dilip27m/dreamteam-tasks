## Bandit OverTheWire  

[Blog Link: Bandit Level 1-20 Review](https://medium.com/@mdilip2909/bandit-level-1-20-be967b1ef93f)  
### Approach i followed 
For each level there are few linux commands in the bandit overwire below the question i use to learn those commands 
and man command helped me a lot and to solve the errors i used google and stackoverflow 

### Review of the task 

These levels are designed to get a grip on linux. First 6 levels commands will be used in linux for everytask (basics)
next 6 levels was about searching for strings. till here it was good but after this i dont think we use them(rarely used)
first 6 was important ,next 6 was ok ,other are not required

### Approach i followed 
I know some basics commands like add,commit,push,checkout etc i have read the documentation provided it having a lot of content
so i did like for example i will ask gogle how to solve merge conflict it will either provide link for documentation or stackoverflow 
i will read the required and solve the challenge ,i use get some errors where everything is correct i was not understanding where the error 
was later i came know it was because of some extra space this irritated me a lot. but fine i learnt a lot 

### Review of the task 
I like the way of explaning the git branching part using animations. It was very easy to understand 
this task was veryhelpful and there are many git commands before starting this task i taught there are only the commands
in git but, after doing this task i got so much knowledge about git
