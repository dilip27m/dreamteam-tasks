# Design with figma
[Wireframes design for desktop ](https://www.figma.com/design/sppkGSy1iErXKolzbktb9F/MovieTalks-new?node-id=10-2)

### Approach i followed
This task is extension to previous task actually previous task was way better than 
this task ,the main issue is i am somewhat weak in color selection and selection colors
names,title etra text part was very difficult i saw many websites to design this 
like facebook,netflix,letterboxd etc

### Review of the task
But this task made the styling easy for my website but i did only half part 
beggning of the webpage and i did other half after completion of webpage as you said 
focus on task 8 and 9
